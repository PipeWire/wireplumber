/*!
 * \struct WpObjectManager
 *
 * The WpObjectManager class provides a way to collect a set of objects and
 * be notified when objects that fulfill a certain set of criteria are created
 * or destroyed.
 *
 * There are 4 kinds of objects that can be managed by a
 * WpObjectManager:
 *   * remote PipeWire global objects that are advertised on the registry;
 *     these are bound locally to subclasses of WpGlobalProxy
 *   * remote PipeWire global objects that are created by calling a remote
 *     factory through the WirePlumber API; these are very similar to other
 *     global objects but it should be noted that the same WpGlobalProxy
 *     instance that created them appears in the WpObjectManager (as soon as
 *     its WP_PROXY_FEATURE_BOUND is enabled)
 *   * local PipeWire objects that are being exported to PipeWire
 *     (WpImplMetadata, WpImplNode, etc); these appear in the
 *     WpObjectManager as soon as they are exported (so, when their
 *     WP_PROXY_FEATURE_BOUND is enabled)
 *   * WirePlumber-specific objects, such as plugins, factories and session items
 *
 * To start an object manager, you first need to declare interest in a certain
 * kind of object by calling wp_object_manager_add_interest() and then install
 * it on the WpCore with wp_core_install_object_manager().
 *
 * Upon installing a WpObjectManager on a WpCore, any pre-existing objects
 * that match the interests of this WpObjectManager will immediately become
 * available to get through wp_object_manager_new_iterator() and the
 * WpObjectManager \c object-added signal will be emitted for all of them.
 * However, note that if these objects need to be prepared (to activate some
 * features on them), the emission of \c object-added will be delayed. To know
 * when it is safe to access the initial set of objects, wait until the
 * \c installed signal has been emitted. That signal is emitted asynchronously
 * after all the initial objects have been prepared.
 *

 * \parblock
 * \code
 * void
 * installed_callback (WpObjectManager * self,
 *                     gpointer user_data)
 * \endcode
 *
 * This is emitted once after the object manager is installed with
 * wp_core_install_object_manager(). If there are objects that need to be
 * prepared asynchronously internally, emission of this signal is delayed
 * until all objects are ready.
 *
 * Flags: G_SIGNAL_RUN_FIRST

 *
 * Emitted when an object that matches the interests of this object manager
 * is made available.
 *
 * Parameters:
 * - `object` - the managed object that was just added
 *
 * Flags: G_SIGNAL_RUN_FIRST

 *                          gpointer user_data)
 * \endcode
 *
 * Emitted when an object that was previously added on this object manager is
 * now being removed (and most likely destroyed). At the time that this signal
 * is emitted, the object is still alive.
 *
 * Parameters:
 * - `object` - the managed object that is being removed
 *
 * Flags: G_SIGNAL_RUN_FIRST

 * \endcode
 *
 * Emitted when one or more objects have been recently added or removed from
 * this object manager. This signal is useful to get notified only once when
 * multiple changes happen in a short timespan. The receiving callback may
 * retrieve the updated list of objects by calling wp_object_manager_new_iterator()
