 * wp_device_new_from_factory(), which creates a new device object
 * on the remote PipeWire server by calling into a factory.

 * \struct WpSpaDevice
 *
 * A WpSpaDevice allows running a `spa_device` object locally,
 * loading the implementation from a SPA factory. This is useful to run device
 * monitors inside the session manager and have control over creating the
 * actual nodes that the `spa_device` requests to create.
 *
 * To enable the spa device, call wp_object_activate() requesting
 * WP_SPA_DEVICE_FEATURE_ENABLED.
 *
 * For actual devices (not device monitors) it also possible and desirable
 * to export the device to PipeWire, which can be done by requesting
 * WP_PROXY_FEATURE_BOUND from wp_object_activate(). When exporting, the
 * export should be done before enabling the device, by requesting both
 * features at the same time.

 * This signal is emitted when the device is creating a managed object

 * unref the reference stored by this function when the managed object is to be
 * destroyed.
 *
 * Parameters:
 * - `id` - the id of the managed object
 * - `type` - the SPA type that the managed object should have
 * - `factory` - the name of the SPA factory to use to construct the managed object
 * - `properties` - additional properties that the managed object should have

 *
 * This signal is emitted when the device has deleted a managed object.
