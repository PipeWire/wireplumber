 * \struct WpPipewireObject
 *
 * An interface for standard PipeWire objects.
 *
 * The common characteristic of all objects that implement this interface is
 * the presence of an "info" structure that contains additional properties
 * for this object (in the form of a spa_dict / pw_properties) and optionally
 * also some parameters that can be enumerated and set on the object.
 *
 * \gproperties
 *
 * \gproperty{properties, WpProperties *, G_PARAM_READABLE,
 *   The properties of the pipewire object}
 *
 * \gproperty{param-info, GVariant * (a{ss}), G_PARAM_READABLE,
 *   The param info of the object}
 *
 * \gproperty{native-info, gpointer, G_PARAM_READABLE,
 *   The native info structure}
 *
 * \gsignals
 *
 * \par params-changed
 * \parblock
 * \code
 * params_changed_callback (WpPipewireObject * self,
 *                          const gchar *id,
 *                          gpointer user_data)
 * \endcode
 *
 * Emitted when the params for id have changed. On proxies that cache params
 * from a remote object, this is emitted after the cached values have changed.
 *
 * You can expect this to be emitted only when the relevant
 * WP_PIPEWIRE_OBJECT_FEATURE_PARAM_* has been activated.
 *
 * Parameters:
 * - `id` - the parameter id as a string (ex "Props", "EnumRoute")
 *
 * Flags: G_SIGNAL_RUN_FIRST
 * \endparblock
